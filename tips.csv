1,"Bundle up with warm accessories. This is one of the easiest ways to save on your heating bill. Instead of turning the heat up, put on a cozy winter sweater and warm socks. Keep throw blankets on your couch, and add an area rug to insulate the floor."
1,"Keep your furnace clean and unblocked. Keeping your furnace and vents properly maintained will reduce energy consumption and help you save. Check your furnace filter monthly, and replace it when it gets dirty."
1,Invest in insulation. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs are lost each year due to escaping heat and cold air in homes without proper insulation. 
1,"Get a humidifier to add moisture to the air. The air inside your home can become very dry. Moist air feels warmer and holds heat better, so a humidifier can help you feel comfortable."
2,Install WaterSense Shower Heads. Showerheads that are labeled as WaterSense are more water efficient than the average shower head.
2,Install a Steam Shower. Steam showers use the power of steam to keep clean but they are also very water efficient. They use less water than a traditional shower and are very relaxing to use.
2,"Grab a bucket. When you turn the water on in the shower and wait for it to heat up, you're wasting all of that cold water. Rather than letting it escape down the drain, consider placing a bucket in the shower during this time"
3,Be good to your fridge. Putting hot food straight into the fridge is a big no-no! The fridge has to work extra hard and draw more energy to cool it down.
3,"Wash smartly. Your washing machine and tumble dryer are two of the most power hungry appliances in the house. Make sure the washing machine is full before you switch it on, or use the half load setting if it has one. "
3,"Clean the oven door. Every time you open the oven door, you are letting out precious hot air and wasting energy. If the oven door is clean and you can actually see through it, then you don’t need to keep opening it to check on your food. "
3,"Use the microwave. Cook food in the microwave whenever you can. When it comes to heating up small portions of food, microwaving is more energy efficient than the hob."
4,"Get the family together to watch TV. A family of 4, all watching television together in the same room, uses _ the energy of the family with TVs in 4 different rooms viewing 4 different programs."
4,Turn down the volume. Turn down or mute the volume entirely for commercials. Using a 2 percent lower volume setting when you watch also saves energy.
4,Turn down the screen lighting. Lower the contrast and brightness on your set and watch TV in low light.
5,"Remove extra BOOT weight in the car. Unwanted items like a flat tyre, unwanted luggage in the vehicle, especially heavy ones, can reduce the vehicle’s mileage."
5,"Beyond one minute, it is more fuel - efficient to restart your car."
5,"Don't forget to keep your vehicle tuned up. When a vehicle is running well, it uses nine per cent less fuel and thus emits fewer toxic and noxious fumes."
6,Use re-usable shopping bags! Most grocery stores now sell inexpensive material shopping bags. These are not only better for the environment but they are stronger than any plastic or paper bag available.
6,Store leftover foods in reusable containers instead of single use plastic bags or Polystyrene foam containers.
6,Compost yard waste which also helps enrich the soil and reduces water run-off.
